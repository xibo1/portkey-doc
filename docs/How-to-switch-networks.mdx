title: How to switch networks?

Portkey currently runs on the aelf blockchain, both on its Mainnet and on its Testnet. Mainnet tokens have real-world value, while Testnet tokens are for testing and typically have no value.
Accounts on Mainnet are not compatible with Testnet, and vice versa. If you want to switch networks without an account on the target network, you'll need to [create one](/docs/How-to-get-a-Portkey-account "") after switching. You can use the same social information, such as email, for registration.

**Switch networks:**

1. On the Portkey home screen, click "My" (App users) / the avatar in the top right-hand corner (extension users).
2. Click "Wallet" > "Switch Networks," select the network you want to switch to and "Confirm."
