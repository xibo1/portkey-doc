title: How to start a private chat?
---

Portkey enables users to have private chats directly with each other.
Alternatively, you can also choose to create/join a group to enjoy [group chat](/docs/How-to-start-a-group-chat "").

**Start a chat with contact:**

1. On the Portkey home screen, click "Chat" (mobile phone users) / the chat icon (extension users).
2. Click the + button at the top right corner of the interface and then select "New Chat."
3. Select from the list of all chattable contacts you already have and start the chat.

**Start a chat with non-contact:**

1. On the Portkey home screen, click "Chat" (mobile phone users) / the chat icon (extension users).
2. Click the + button at the top right corner of the interface and then select "Find People."
3. Enter the user's wallet address, Portkey ID or email and search.

**View Portkey ID:**
Click "My" on the home screen and then "Wallet" > "My Wallet". You will see your Portkey ID and all the wallet addresses linked to your account, including your MainChain and SideChain addresses.
